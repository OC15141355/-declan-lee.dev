A comprehensive task management application that allows teams to collaborate in real-time, track progress, and manage projects efficiently.

## Features

- Real-time updates using Socket.IO
- Drag-and-drop task organization
- Team collaboration tools
- Task commenting and attachment support
- Project and sprint planning tools
- Performance analytics and reports

## Implementation

This project was built with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. It uses Socket.IO for real-time communication, MongoDB for data storage, and Material UI for the component library.

## Challenges

Creating a seamless real-time collaboration experience was the biggest challenge. I implemented a robust synchronization system that handles concurrent edits and resolves conflicts intelligently. The application also needed to work offline, so I implemented a local-first architecture with background sync.
