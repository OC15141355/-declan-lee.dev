import { Carousel } from '../../components/common/Carousel';

Liminal Portfolio is a sophisticated single-page application built with React and TypeScript that showcases my projects and blog content through distinctly themed sections with smooth transitions. The application features a consistent architectural pattern across different sections while providing unique visual identities for each area.

## Project Highlights

### Architecture & Design

The portfolio employs a modular, context-driven architecture with these key features:

- **Distinct Themed Sections**: Each section (Home, Projects, Blog) has a unique visual identity with custom animations and styling while maintaining cohesive design language
- **Context-Based State Management**: Custom state management implementation with React Context API and reducers, supplemented by Zustand for global state
- **Performance-Optimized Animations**: Custom animation components with automatic performance adjustments based on device capabilities
- **Responsive & Accessible Design**: Fully responsive layouts with accessibility considerations including reduced motion preferences

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management

The application follows a pattern of separation between different types of state:

```typescript
// Multiple specialized stores for different concerns
export const useBlogDataStore = create<BlogDataState>((set) => ({
  blogPosts: [],
  setBlogPosts: (posts) => set({ blogPosts: posts }),
  selectedPost: null,
  // Additional state and actions...
}));

export const useBlogFilterStore = create<BlogFilterState>((set) => ({
  selectedTag: null,
  setSelectedTag: (tag) => set({ selectedTag: tag }),
  // Additional filter state...
}));
```

#### Transitions & Animations

The application features a custom transition system for moving between sections:

```typescript
// TransitionZone component creates smooth visual transitions
<TransitionZone 
  id="transition-home-projects"
  ref={(el) => observeSection(el)}
  fromTheme={theme.home} 
  toTheme={theme.projects}
  reduceMotion={prefersReducedMotion}
/>
```

#### Blog System

The blog implementation features:
- Markdown content with frontmatter for metadata
- Category and tag organization with visual styling
- Series support for multi-part content
- Table of contents generation
- Search functionality across all fields

#### Projects Showcase

The projects section includes:
- Featured project highlighting
- Interactive timeline for chronological exploration
- Tech stack display with categorization
- Filtering by technologies and categories

## Development Insights

### Performance Considerations

The portfolio implements several strategies to ensure smooth performance:
- **Lazy Loading**: Sections are loaded only when needed
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive components
- **Performance Monitoring**: Custom utilities for measuring and tracking render counts
- **Responsive Animation**: Animations automatically adjust based on device capabilities

### Testing Strategy

The application includes a comprehensive testing infrastructure:
- Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Custom mock implementations for browser APIs
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Performance-aware test utilities

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Integration with a headless CMS for easier content management
- Expanded analytics, SEO and visitor tracking
