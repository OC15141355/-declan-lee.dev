A single-page application portfolio website featuring three distinct themed sections with smooth transitions and animations. Built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js.

## Features

- Smooth section transitions with Framer Motion
- 3D elements with Three.js
- Responsive design for all devices
- Dark mode support
- SEO optimized

## Implementation

The site leverages React for component structure, TypeScript for type safety, and advanced animation libraries to create a captivating user experience while maintaining performance. Each section has its own theme, transitioning smoothly as the user scrolls.

## Challenges

Creating performant 3D animations that work well across all devices presented several challenges. I optimized the Three.js elements to ensure smooth performance even on mobile devices, and implemented progressive enhancement to provide a good experience regardless of device capabilities.
