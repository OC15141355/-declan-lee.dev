A cross-platform mobile application that provides accurate weather forecasts, interactive radar maps, and customizable weather alerts based on user locations.

## Features

- 7-day and hourly weather forecasts
- Interactive weather maps with radar data
- Location-based weather alerts
- Multiple saved locations
- Weather widgets for home screen
- Dark mode and customizable themes

## Implementation

This application was built using React Native and Expo for cross-platform compatibility. It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API for forecast data and Google Maps API for location and mapping features. State management is handled with Redux.

## Challenges

Ensuring accurate weather data across different global regions was a significant challenge. I implemented a data validation and fallback system that cross-references multiple weather data sources to provide the most reliable forecasts. The app also needed to be highly performant while displaying complex animated radar maps, requiring careful optimization.
