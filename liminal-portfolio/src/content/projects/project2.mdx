Providence is a comprehensive web application designed to democratise access to political information in Australia, making government processes and decision-making more transparent and accessible to all citizens. The application serves as a centralised hub where users can explore detailed information about their political representatives, track policy developments, monitor voting records and stay informed about political news.

## Project Highlights

### Architecture & Features

The application provides a rich set of features centered around four main areas: politicians, policies, parliamentary votes and news. Key features include:

- **Politician Profiles**: Detailed information including voting histories, policy positions, and attendance records
- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive charts showing voting patterns and policy support levels
- **Comparison Tools**: Side-by-side comparison of politicians across various metrics
- **Location-Based Features**: Find representatives based on postcode or location
- **News Integration**: Political news linked to relevant politicians and policies
- **Dual Mode Operation**: API mode (external data) and Database mode (mock data)

### Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React with Redux for state management
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for interactive charts and graphs
- **Styling**: Styled Components and Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest and MSW for API mocking
- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify with CodeCommit for CI/CD

### Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Complexity**: Implemented data normalization and caching strategies
- **Performance**: Optimized chart rendering and implemented lazy loading
- **Accessibility**: Ensured WCAG compliance and theme contrast ratios
- **Offline Support**: Implemented service worker caching for core features
