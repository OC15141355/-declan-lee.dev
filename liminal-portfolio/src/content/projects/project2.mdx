A complete e-commerce solution built with Next.js and MongoDB, featuring product listings, shopping cart functionality, user authentication, and Stripe payment integration.

## Features

- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- User authentication and profile management
- Product search and filtering
- Responsive design for mobile shopping
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Order tracking and history

## Implementation

This project uses Next.js for both server-side rendering and API routes, MongoDB for data storage, and Stripe for payment processing. The frontend employs Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Challenges

Implementing real-time inventory updates and ensuring payment security were key challenges. I created a webhook system to handle Stripe events and developed a locking mechanism to prevent inventory conflicts during checkout.
