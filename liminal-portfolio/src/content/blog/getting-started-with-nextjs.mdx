# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits over a standard React application:

- **Server-side rendering**: Improves performance and SEO
- **Static site generation**: Creates static HTML at build time
- **File-based routing**: Simplifies the routing process
- **API Routes**: Allows creating serverless functions

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This sets up a new Next.js project with the default template.

## Core Features

### Pages and Routing

Next.js uses file-based routing. Any file inside the pages directory becomes a route.

### Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data:

- `getStaticProps`: Fetch data at build time
- `getServerSideProps`: Fetch data on each request
- `getStaticPaths`: Specify dynamic routes to pre-render

### API Routes

Create API endpoints by adding files to the pages/api directory.

## Building a Basic Page

Let's create a simple page component:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
      <p>This is a simple Next.js page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications, providing a great developer experience while ensuring high performance and SEO-friendly websites. By leveraging its built-in features, you can focus on building your application rather than configuring tools.
